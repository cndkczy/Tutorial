# Tutorial for phyllotaxy images analysis

## Introduction 

Here we aim to evaluate the maize plant canopy orientation by directly measure azimuthal leaf orientations from top view UAV images.
Each image normally contains four rows of plants with same genotype. The middle two rows will be selected for the measurement.
The relative angles to the planting row of the top-most leaves from each side of a plant are then measured using imageJ. This enable us to display the distribution of the azimutal angles of these leaves in a polar chart.

As shown in the following image, the mutant and its relative wild type control exhibit different canopy orientation.
